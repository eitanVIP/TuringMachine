# Turing Machine
A busy beaver kind turing machine that can execute rules and draw the board.\
In addition there is a random rule generator.

## Randomly Generated Examples
These are randomly generated rules and turing machines that created these boards.

**The Kinda Binary Counter**\
Counts in binary from the right side. every few frames the number goes up by one and then there are a lot of frames where it fixes the number to be correct before countinuing to count.
